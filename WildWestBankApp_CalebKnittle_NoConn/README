Tumbleweed Banking and Trust Company (TB&T) - Wild West Banking App

About this Application:
This application can be used to simulate financial transactions with a Wild-West-themed 
financial institution (TB&T).

Current users may login or, if they are a new user, may register as a user. Once logged-in,
a user may view and update their personal profile, view and manage their accounts, view their
previous transactions, and delete their own user profile.

A Super-User may be created using a specified administrator password before creating their other
user credentials. A super-user can perform all of the functions of a normal user, but they are also
able to view, update, delete, and perform other user functions for any user. A super-user may also
view all users or all accounts in the database at once.


How to Use this Application:
When prompted, type the number(s) or character(s) corresponding to the listed function you would like
to perform, or you may need to type some other input for a username, password, etc. Press Enter to
confirm your choice or submit your input.
